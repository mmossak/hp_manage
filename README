UWSGI restart script

To be used: HP_restart_uwsgi.sh

Script prepared for sample python flask/uwsgi/nginx stack as per 
https://iotbytes.wordpress.com/python-flask-web-application-on-raspberry-pi-with-nginx-and-uwsgi/

Script finds last tracked uwsgi master processes in /var/log/uwsgi.log file, checks whether those are running and then kills.
After that it uses the same script placed in rc.local to start uwsgi server.

Restart is needed if you change your Flask app. Only then changes are visible in python script
